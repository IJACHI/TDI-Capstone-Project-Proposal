# TDI-Capstone-Project-Proposal
This is a proposal to create a program that can predict the timing, location and magnitude of an earthquake using historical data. From the jupyter notebook, you can see from the map chart of earthquakes in mexico that there is a pattern to the occurence of earthquakes. It is also evident from the annual frequency chart that the number of earthquakes have been increasing in recent years. Historical data on factors responsible for earthquakes will be used in predicting the time, location and magnitude of earthquakes.
